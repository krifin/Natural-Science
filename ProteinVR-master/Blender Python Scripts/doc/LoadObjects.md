LoadObjects.py: Automate the task of loading in large numbers of files into Blender

    - This script is ran only in the Blender Terminal! 
    - Make sure to change the path in the beginning of the script inside the os.chdir() command to the directory where your text file of all the objects is stored!
    - The text file that has all the object files that you want to load in has to be delimited by a new line for each object 
    - Make sure to comment out the part that deals with keyword importation if you do not want to filter your list of objects and only import those with a specific keyword

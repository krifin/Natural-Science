ObjectsToTxt.py: A quick script to convert all the encountered .obj files within a directory to a .txt file that is new line delimited for each object

    - Make sure to change the raw strings for the path and output directory in the locations that are clearly labeled to be changed! 
    - You must run this script before you can run LoadObjects.py, unless you have a text file with all the objects you want to load in (in a new
    line delimited fashion)
    - Make sure to input forward slashes for everything when replacing the path variables
